# My Routine

A progress-tracking tool for people learning an instrument. Allows users to keep a flexible practice schedule regardless of what instrument they're learning.

## Demo

You can no longer see it in action because I currently host all of my applications on a Linux VM and My Routine can only be hosted on a Windows server.
